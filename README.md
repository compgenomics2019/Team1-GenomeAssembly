# Computational Genomics Genome Assembly Pipeline

This pipeline is designed to assemble genomes from Illumina reads using a number of 
assembly programs and techniques (*de novo* and reference guided).  
It also supports the creation of a "meta" assembly, which is a consensus sequence based on assemblies from SPAdes, Velvet and ABYSS.

## Requirements

This pipeline assumes these packages are installed and can be found in PATH.

 - pandas
 - numpy
