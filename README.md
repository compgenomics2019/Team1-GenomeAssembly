# Computational Genomics Genome Assembly Pipeline

## SUMMARY

This pipeline is designed to assemble genomes from Illumina reads using a number of assembly programs and techniques (*de novo* and reference guided).  It also supports the creation of a "meta" assembly, which is a consensus sequence based on assemblies from SPAdes, Velvet and ABYSS.
